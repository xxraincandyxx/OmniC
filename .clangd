# Recommended .clangd configuration for the OmniC C project.
# This configuration relies on the compile_commands.json generated by CMake
# for all compiler flags.

# --- Diagnostics Settings ---
# Configure the linter (Clang-Tidy) and other diagnostic tools.
Diagnostics:
  # Enable a useful set of Clang-Tidy checks.
  # These are good general-purpose checks for C code.
  ClangTidy:
    Add: [
      bugprone-*,          # Checks for common bug patterns
      performance-*,        # Checks for performance issues
      readability-*,        # Checks for code that is hard to read
      portability-*         # Checks for code that is not portable across platforms
    ]
    # Example of how to disable a specific check if it's too noisy for you:
    # Remove: [readability-magic-numbers]

  # Report unused #include directives as errors. This helps keep code clean.
  UnusedIncludes: Strict


# --- Indexing Settings ---
# Control how clangd builds its index for features like "Go to Definition".
Index:
  # Index the project in the background for faster navigation. This is the default
  # and recommended setting.
  Background: Build

  # Clangd 11+ will automatically index the standard library.
  # This setting is generally not needed anymore but does no harm.
  StandardLibrary: Yes
